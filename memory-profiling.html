 <h1>System-wide Memory Profiling</h1>

<h1>System memory usage is confusing!</h1>
<ul class=incremental>
<li>Caches confuse free memory
<li>Shared mappings confuse used memory
<li>The system appears to use more memory than is available!
</ul>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h1>Important questions are hard to answer</h1>
<ul class=incremental>
<li>Where is my memory being used?
<li>How "big" is a running application?
<li>What parts of it are taking up the most memory?
<li>What parts of it are the most active (working set)?
<li>How much memory do I need to launch an application?
<li>How many threads can I run?
<li>Can I fit all this junk on my phone?
</ul>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h1>Problem: the numbers are meaningless!</h1>
<ul class=incremental>
<li>VSS hardly ever is relevant
<li>RSS doesn't tell you how much of a process is shared
<li>/proc/pid/smaps doesn't give you enough information either!
<li>All the numbers change when memory pressure changes!
</ul>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h1>Problem: the VM is a black box</h1>
<ul class=incremental>
 <li>The information we need to answer the hard questions is hard to get
 <li>We can't tell which pages are mapped
 <li>We can't tell which pages are shared or with who
 <li>Let's expose some of the underlying data!
</ul>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h1>/proc/pid/pagemap</h1>
<ul class=incremental>
 <li>A virtual file containing a PFN for each page in the address space
 <li>Comparing two or more pagemaps reveals sharing
 <li>This can be very big!
 <li>Use /proc/pid/maps and seek to use efficiently
 <li>pagemapwatch - realtime view into process address space
 <li>(aka My First GTK App)
</ul>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h1>/proc/kpagemap</h1>
<ul class=incremental>
 <li>A virtual file containing a count and flags for each page of RAM
 <li>kpagemapwatch - realtime view into kernel memory map
 <li>kpagemapflagswatch - realtime view of kernel page flags
 <li>pagemapsharewatch - shows per-process sharing
</ul>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h1>More on the RSS problem</h1>
<ul class=incremental>
 <li>Virtual Set Size (VSS) is an absolute upper bound
 <li>Resident Set Size (RSS) measures memory usage in isolation
 <li>What we need is a good approximation of process footprint
</ul>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h1>Proposal: PSS and USS</h1>
<ul class=incremental>
 <li>Proportional Set Size (PSS) discounts shared pages
 <li>Totals up nicely, 
 <li>Unique Set Size (USS) counts only unshared pages
 <li>Good measure of incremental cost of adding and removing threads
 <li>Unfortunately both are slightly expensive to calculate
 <li>VSS &gt;= RSS &gt;= PSS &gt;= USS
</ul>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h1>Looking at PSS and USS</h1>
<ul class=incremental>
 <li>pagemap + kpagemap make examining new metrics easy
 <li>memstats - show statistics for a set of processes
 <li>memrank - show sorted stats for entire system
</ul>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h1>What about memory pressure?</h1>
<ul class=incremental>
 <li>All our numbers change under pressure
 <li>How much can we fit in memory before performance suffers?
 <li>Working set: minimum set of pages needed to run "efficiently"
 <li>Technique #1 - slowly increase memory pressure until thrashing occurs
 <li>Technique #2 - use active bits with /proc/pid/clear_refs
 <li>With pagemap approach, we can directly identify the working set pages
</ul>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h1>Current status</h1>
<ul class=incremental>
 <li>Initial patches in 2.6.20-rc6-mm1
 <li>Example scripts available at http://selenic.com/repo/pagemap/
</ul>
