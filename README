These are demo scripts for the /proc/pid/pagemap and /proc/kpagemap
interfaces that appeared in Linux 2.6.20-rc6-mm1. 

As they're just demos, they're easy to break and they'll probably fail
miserably on 64-bit machines or machines with page sizes other than
4096. 

You'll need Python 2.4 or better and the Python-GTK package. Enjoy.
